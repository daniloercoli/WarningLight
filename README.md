# WarningLight Demo App

This is a basic warning light app I built in a few hours as a quick example. I often use it when I get off the bus and realize I've forgotten my blinking light.

I created this app because the existing options on the App Store all include ads and video ads, which I find very annoying.

This app is a simple, ad-free alternative for those who need a basic warning light function.

## Features
- Basic warning light functionality
- No ads
- Lightweight and easy to use

## Download
You can download it [here](https://github.com/daniloercoli/WarningLight/releases/tag/v1.0).

Feel free to use and modify this app as needed. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
